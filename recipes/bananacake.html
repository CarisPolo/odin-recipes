    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>There is nothing better than a piece of banana bread in the morning with a cup of coffee. This recipe is more of a cake texture, and is super simple to make. In fact, Bisquick mix is one of the ingredients! You can easily buy this from the store, then add all your favourite extras (nuts, chocolate etc.). The result is a very moist, delicious, and flavourful banana cake that can amp up your favourite breakfast.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 to 3 large ripe bananas, mashed (about 1 1/3 cups), plus 1 large banana, sliced</li>
        <li>2/3 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup milk</li>
        <li>3 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>2 2/3 cups Bisquick mix (from the store or homemade)</li>
        <li>3/4 cup chopped walnuts or pecans (optional, but highly recommended)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Grab a large bowl and stir together the mashed bananas, sugar, milk, oil, cinnamon, and eggs. Once that is combined, stir in the Bisquick mix and the nuts, fold in the banana slices.</li>
        <li>Spread the batter into a greased 13×9-inch pan, then mix up the streusel. The streusel topping also uses Bisquick mix as its base, so it’s super simple to throw together as well. Just cut together Bisquick, brown sugar, more chopped nuts, and some cold butter and sprinkle this over the top of the cake batter.</li>
        <li>Bake the banana coffee cake for around 30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li>If you’re in the mood for a bit more sweetness, feel free to drizzle the cake with some maple syrup before digging in!</li>
    </ol>
