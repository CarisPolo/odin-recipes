    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>There is nothing better than a piece of banana bread in the morning with a cup of coffee. This recipe is more of a cake texture, and is super simple to make. In fact, Bisquick mix is one of the ingredients! You can easily buy this from the store, then add all your favourite extras (nuts, chocolate etc.). The result is a very moist, delicious, and flavourful banana cake that can amp up your favourite breakfast.</p>

        <li>2 to 3 large ripe bananas, mashed (about 1 1/3 cups), plus 1 large banana, sliced</li>

        <li>1/4 cup milk</li>
        <li>3 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
