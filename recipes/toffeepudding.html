        <p>Recipe taken from <a href="https://www.spoonforkbacon.com/">Spoon Fork Bacon</a></p>

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>If you are not familiar with traditional toffee pudding, it is comprised of a soft, fluffy sponge cake made with dates, covered in rich toffee sauce, and topped with a vanilla custard or cream. This delicious recipe is very similar to that classic comfort food favourite, with a few minor additions. Cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves add a level of depth and flavour. This recipe also swaps out the richer, and denser custard for a lighter whipped cream. What you are left with is a fluffy, chewy, moist cake with the delicious decadence of a classic toffee sauce.</p>
