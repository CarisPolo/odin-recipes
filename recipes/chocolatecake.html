        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>In my opinion nothing quite beats a simple chocolate cake. Most of the time I would resort to making one from the box, becuase if we're being honest there's just something about a Betty Crocker chocolate cake. Every so often when I'm feeling ambitious I like to attempt making one from scratch. For anyone who isn't a pastry chef, or regular baker, making a cake can be challenging and messy. This recipe, however, is simple, delicious, and guaranteed to be a crowd pleaser.</p>

        <p>The ingredients and steps in this recipe are simple. The one key step that makes all the difference is adding milk that has been brought to a simmer. The warm whole milk will prevent your cake from becoming crumbly from hydrating all the ingredients, and it will also add flavour.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>Cake:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>3/4 cup cocoa powder</li>
            <li>2 tsp baking powder</li>
            <li>3/4 tsp baking soda</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tsp fine sea salt</li>
            <li>1 cup granualated sugar</li>
            <li>3/4 firmly packed light brown sugar</li>
            <li>2 large egg yolks</li>
            <li>1/2 cup neutral tasting oil</li>
            <li>1 tbsp pure vanilla extract</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 3/4 cups whole milk</li>
            <li>Dark chocolate (for decorating)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Frosting:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 cups powdered sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup cocoa powder</li>
            <li>Generous pinch of salt</li>
            <li>1/2 <strong>unsalted butter</strong>, softened</li>
            <li>1/4-1/2 cup whole milk, to thin</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <h3>Cake:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees (180 celcius). Grease the bottom of 2 (9-inch/ 23-cm) springform pans. Line the bottoms with parchment paper, and grease the parchment paper and walls of the pan.</li>
            <li>Into a larger bowl, sift the all-purpose flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Add the granulated sugar and brown sugar, and whisk until thoroughtly combined.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the 2 egg yolks. While whisking continuously, slowly drizzle in the neutral-tasting oil just until it begins to thicken and emulsify and then whisk in the vanilla extract. Then continue to slowly drizzle in the remaining oil while whisking constantly.</li>
            <li>Once all the oil has been added, add the 2 eggs and whisk to combine. Then pour the wet mixture into the dry ingredients and fold together until combined into a crumbly mixture</li>
            <li>In a small pot, heat the whole milk just until it begins to simmer, but do not let it boil. Once simmering, slowly pour the milk into the crumbly mixture while continuously whisking until everything is incorporated and smooth.</li>
            <li>Divide the mixture evenly between the prepared cake pans. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Let cool in the cake pans for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove the sides of the pans, and carefully invert the cakes onto a wire rack. Remove the parchment paper from the bottoms. Let the cakes cool completely upside down. Prepare the frosting (see below).</li>
            <li>To frost the cakes, place 1 cake upside down on a cake stand or cutting board. Add about 1 cup frosting to the center, and spread it out evenly.</li>
            <li>Place the second cake right-side up on top of the upside-down cake, and press down to make sure it sticks together. Spread the rest of the frosting on top and all over the sides to seal the edges.</li>
            <li>Once the cake is completely frosted and covered, freshly grate dark chocolate on top of the cake (if using). Slice, and enjoy!</li>
            <li>To store, cover the cake with a large bowl or cake dome and let sit at room temperature for up to 2 days. Then refrigerate, covered, for 3 to 5 days.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Frosting:</h3>
        <p>In a medium bowl, whisk together the 4 cups of powedered sugar, 1/2 cup cocoa powder, and a generous pinch of sea salt. In the bowl of the stand mixer or in a medium bowl, beat the 1/2 cup softened <strong>unsalted</strong> butter on medium speed until creamy. Add the powdered sugar mixture in batches until it is thoroughly combined with the butter. Thin out the frosting as desired using splashes of whole milk while the mixer is running until thick but spreadable</p>
